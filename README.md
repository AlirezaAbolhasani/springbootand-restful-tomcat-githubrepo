# springbootand-restful-tomcat-githubrepo

This is a perfect restful web service sample that helps you to understand better the concept of web services and how to use Annotations for creating a repository and connect to a bean and use that with a controller in this paradigm.
I don't use Database for many reasons in this tutorial. The first and more important one is in this tutorial your focus should be on webservice and concept of that not anything Else.

Use bellow JSON Code for Calling your web service:


{
	"name":"Ali Reza Abolhasani"
}
